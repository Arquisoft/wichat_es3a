|Term |Definition

|LLM (Large Language Model)
|Large Language Model based on artificial intelligence and deep learning. It is used to process and generate text with contextual understanding, such as OpenAI’s GPT, Google Bard, and others.

|Microservices Architecture
|A software architecture style in which an application is divided into small independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each microservice focuses on a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

|Docker
|A containerization platform that allows packaging applications and their dependencies into portable containers. It facilitates consistent execution across different environments without worrying about compatibility issues.

|JavaScript
|An interpreted programming language primarily used for web development. It enables the creation of interactive and dynamic pages, functioning both in the browser and on the server through environments like Node.js.

|React
|A JavaScript library developed by Meta (Facebook) for building interactive and efficient user interfaces. It utilizes a component-based model and a Virtual DOM to improve performance in web applications.

|Node.js
|A server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome's V8 engine. It allows building scalable and high-performance applications using an asynchronous, event-driven programming model.

|Backend
|The part of an application that handles business logic, databases, authentication, and communication with the frontend. It is typically developed using technologies such as Node.js, Python, or Java.

|Frontend
|The visual interface of an application with which users interact. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

|Express.js
|A minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of applications and APIs. It provides tools for handling routing, middleware, and HTTP requests efficiently.

|API (Application Programming Interface)
|A set of protocols and tools that allow different software components to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats for interacting with an application or service.

|MongoDB
|A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is designed for scalability and performance, making it suitable for modern applications requiring large volumes of unstructured data.

|Authentication
|The process of verifying the identity of a user or system, typically through credentials like usernames and passwords. It ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources or services.

|Authorization
|The process of granting or denying access to specific resources based on the authenticated identity. It determines what actions a user or system is allowed to perform within an application.

|Docker Compose
|A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows users to define all services (e.g., databases, APIs) in a `docker-compose.yml` file and manage them with a single command.

|CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
|A set of practices that involve automatically integrating and testing code changes in a shared repository (CI), and automatically deploying those changes to production (CD). It helps ensure faster delivery and higher quality of software.

|Swagger
|A framework for API documentation and testing. Swagger provides tools for auto-generating API documentation, allowing both developers and users to understand and interact with the API endpoints.

|WebSocket
|A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It is commonly used for real-time applications, such as live chat or gaming.

|Unit Test
|A software testing technique that involves testing individual components or units of a program in isolation. Unit tests help identify bugs early and ensure that each component works as expected.

|Integration Test
|A testing technique where individual software components are tested together to ensure they function correctly as a whole. It typically tests interactions between services, databases, or external APIs.

|Web Application Firewall (WAF)
|A security system that monitors and filters HTTP traffic to and from a web application. It helps protect against common threats, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

|JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
|A lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines. JSON is often used for transmitting data between a server and a web application.

|WebSocket
|A communication protocol that enables bidirectional, real-time communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. WebSockets are commonly used for applications like live chat or real-time notifications.
