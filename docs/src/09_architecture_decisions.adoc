== Architecture Decisions

=== Architecture design

==== Microservices
Use of a microservices-based architecture for the project.
- **Status**
Approved
- **Context**
A scalable and modular architecture was required for the project. A microservices structure was preferred due to the flexibility it offers in distributing responsibilities, independently scaling components, and supporting long-term system evolution.
- **Alternatives Considered**
  - **Microservices** – Chosen for its ability to decouple components, enable independent deployments, and improve maintainability in distributed teams.
  - **Modular Monolith** – Considered for its simplicity, but limited in terms of scalability and long-term adaptability.
  - **Serverless Functions** – Evaluated for specific components, but not suitable as the main architecture due to orchestration and monitoring complexity.
- **Decision**
We chose a **microservices architecture** as the foundation for the project. This decision aligns with the need to independently scale certain services, maintain a clear separation of concerns, and allow teams to work in parallel. Each service will have its own lifecycle and will communicate through well-defined APIs (REST or gRPC), using asynchronous messaging where appropriate.
In parallel, we decided to use **TypeScript with React** on the frontend, providing a robust codebase and a gradual transition from JavaScript.
- **Consequences**
  - Enables independent scaling of services based on demand.
  - Improves maintainability by decoupling business logic into autonomous services.
  - Facilitates parallel work among multiple teams or developers.
  - Introduces complexity in service orchestration, monitoring, and deployment.
  - Requires a clear strategy for communication, service discovery, and failure handling.
  - Some team members will need time to get familiar with a distributed architecture.
  - Establishes a solid foundation for the project's growth and long-term maintainability.

==== REST
Use of RESTful APIs with JSON as the communication protocol between microservices.
**Status**
Approved
**Context**
Given the choice of a microservices architecture, a communication protocol was needed to enable interaction between services. REST, using HTTP and JSON, was selected for its simplicity, ubiquity, and ease of integration across different services and languages.
**Alternatives Considered**
* **REST with JSON** – Chosen for its wide adoption, human readability, and straightforward implementation using HTTP standards.
* **gRPC** – Considered for its performance and strong typing, but requires more tooling and is less accessible for teams unfamiliar with Protocol Buffers.
* **GraphQL** – Evaluated for client-to-service communication, but not ideal for service-to-service interactions due to complexity and over-fetching/under-fetching concerns in internal APIs.
**Decision**
We chose to use **RESTful APIs with JSON** as the standard for inter-service communication. REST provides a simple, stateless model that aligns well with HTTP-based infrastructure and can be easily implemented and consumed by all services. JSON was selected for its readability and native support in JavaScript and TypeScript environments.
**Consequences**
* Simplifies service integration with well-understood HTTP semantics.
* Facilitates debugging and monitoring due to human-readable payloads.
* Promotes loose coupling between services via clear API contracts.
* May introduce performance overhead compared to binary protocols in high-throughput scenarios.

=== Development technologies

==== TypeScript
Usage of TypeScript for the backend and frontend development.
**Status**
Modified (!)
**Context**
A language was needed for web development, and a statically typed one was preferred over a dynamically typed one.
**Alternatives Considered**
* **TypeScript**
* **Java with SpringBoot**
**Decision**
Since the initial code in the repository was in JavaScript, we ultimately chose TypeScript (even though several team members are not very experienced with it) because otherwise, we would have had to migrate the entire project to Java with Spring.
**Consequences**
It is expected to be easier to identify errors during programming and to avoid using Spring annotations for web-level functionality.

==== Node.js
Usage of Node.js for the backend development.
**Status**
Approved
**Context**
A platform was needed for web development, and the base project was already in Node.js
**Alternatives Considered**
* **Node.js**
* **SpringBoot**
**Decision**
Since the initial code in the repository was already in Node.js, we ultimately chose it (even though several team members are not very experienced with it) because otherwise, we would have had to migrate the entire project to Java with SpringBoot.
**Consequences**
It is expected to be easier to identify errors during programming and to avoid using Spring annotations for web-level functionality.

==== React & TypeScript
Usage of React with TypeScript for the frontend development.
**Status**
Approved
**Context**
A programming language was needed for frontend development. A statically typed language was preferred over a dynamically typed one to improve maintainability, scalability, and early error detection during development.
**Alternatives Considered**
* **TypeScript with React**
* **Html with swig**
**Decision**
Since the initial code in the repository was written in JavaScript with React we chose to use **TypeScript with React**.
Although some team members lack extensive experience with TypeScript, this choice allows for an easier transition from JavaScript and avoids the need for a complete migration to a Java + Spring Boot stack, which would be more time-consuming and complex.
**Consequences**
* Improves error detection at compile-time thanks to static typing.
* Maintains compatibility and continuity with the existing codebase.
* Avoids using Spring annotations and configuration on the frontend.
* Some team members may face a learning curve when adapting to TypeScript.
* Encourages a more robust and maintainable codebase in the long term.

==== MongoDB
Usage of MongoDB as the primary database for the project.
===== Status
Approved
===== Context
A database was needed for the project. A NoSQL option was preferred due to the flexibility it offers in handling unstructured data and its seamless integration with Node.js. MongoDB, being a document-based NoSQL database, fits well with our technology stack.
===== Alternatives Considered
* **MongoDB** – Chosen for its native support in JavaScript/Node.js environments, flexible schema design, and active community support.
* **Firebase** – Considered for its real-time capabilities, but less flexible for complex queries and self-hosting.
* **CouchDB** – Offers similar document storage but lacks the maturity and community support of MongoDB.
===== Decision
We chose **MongoDB** as the primary database for the project. Given that the backend is written in JavaScript using Node.js, MongoDB offers seamless integration and a flexible, schema-less design that accelerates development.
In parallel, we decided to use **TypeScript with React** on the frontend. Although some team members have limited experience with TypeScript, it enables a smoother transition from JavaScript while improving code quality and maintainability.
===== Consequences
* Allows scalable and flexible data modeling with a NoSQL approach.
* Integrates naturally with the Node.js ecosystem, reducing development friction.
* Improves error detection at compile-time on the frontend thanks to static typing with TypeScript.
* Maintains compatibility and continuity with the existing JavaScript codebase.
* Avoids the need for a complete migration to a Java + Spring Boot stack.
* Some team members may require time to adapt to TypeScript and MongoDB.
* Encourages a more robust, maintainable, and modern development workflow.

=== Infrastructure

==== Docker
Use of Docker for containerization of services and infrastructure components.
===== Status
Approved
===== Context
At the start of the project, we needed a standardized way to build, run, and deploy services consistently across different environments and team members’ machines. Docker was proposed as the foundation for the project to encapsulate application environments and dependencies. It aligns with modern DevOps practices and supports scalability and portability, especially in a microservices architecture.
===== Alternatives Considered
* **Docker** – Chosen for its maturity, extensive documentation, and wide industry adoption. Enables environment consistency and simplifies CI/CD processes.
* **Podman** – Considered for its daemonless and rootless architecture, but lacked team familiarity and broader ecosystem integration.
* **Manual setup with local environments** – Rejected due to inconsistency, high onboarding effort, and poor scalability for a microservices-based project.
===== Decision
We adopted **Docker** as the core tool for containerizing all services and infrastructure components in the project. Each microservice runs in its own container, with Docker Compose used for local orchestration and environment setup. This ensures consistent behavior across development, testing, and production environments.
===== Consequences
* Guarantees consistent environments across all stages of development.
* Simplifies onboarding by reducing environment setup to a single command.
* Enhances reproducibility, isolation, and portability of services.
* Serves as a foundation for future deployment with container orchestration tools (Azure).

=== Strategies

==== Trunk-Based Development
Use of Trunk-Based Development for managing the main branch (master) and releases.
===== Status
Approved
===== Context
A protection of the main branch (master) was required to prevent direct commits and to have stricter branch control, as well as a way to manage releases.
===== Alternatives
* **TBD**
* **Direct Pull Request to master**
===== Decision
The decision was made to use Trunk-Based Development since it met all the required needs. All branches originate from the develop branch, and once the sprint is completed, it is merged into master to prepare the release, thus protecting the main branch from errors.
===== Consequences
This approach is expected to keep the master branch clean and facilitate releases while preventing direct commits.

==== CI/CD – GitHub Actions
Adoption of GitHub Actions as the platform for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
===== Status
Approved
===== Context
The project was initialized from a base template that already included predefined workflows using GitHub Actions. The team needed an integrated CI/CD solution that supports automation of tests, builds, and deployments. GitHub Actions, being native to the GitHub ecosystem, provides seamless integration with the repository and requires minimal additional tooling.
===== Alternatives Considered
* **GitHub Actions** – Chosen due to its presence in the project template, native integration with GitHub, and sufficient capabilities for CI/CD pipelines.
* **GitLab CI/CD** – Considered for its powerful pipeline syntax and features, but not applicable since the project is hosted on GitHub.
* **Jenkins** – Known for its flexibility and plugins, but introduces overhead in setup, maintenance, and infrastructure management.
===== Decision
We decided to continue using **GitHub Actions** as the primary CI/CD tool for the project. Since workflows were already defined in the base template, this decision enabled the team to maintain momentum without switching platforms or rewriting existing automation. GitHub Actions handles automated testing, building Docker images, and deploying services.
===== Consequences
* Enables fast and easy automation of CI/CD directly within the GitHub ecosystem.
* Reduces setup time by leveraging existing workflow templates.
* Provides visibility and traceability of pipeline runs in pull requests and commits.
* May require optimization as the project grows in complexity or if advanced pipeline features are needed.

=== Documentation

==== API – OpenAPI
Use of OpenAPI for documenting the RESTful API.
===== Status
Approved
===== Context
The project includes a RESTful API that needs to be clearly documented for both internal and external developers. Accurate, machine-readable API documentation is essential to ensure ease of integration, testing, and long-term maintenance. OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) was selected for its standardization, tooling ecosystem, and compatibility with REST principles.
===== Alternatives Considered
* **OpenAPI** – Chosen for its wide adoption, strong tooling (e.g., Swagger UI, Codegen), and ability to produce both interactive and machine-readable documentation.
* **Manual Markdown Documentation** – Considered for simplicity, but rejected due to lack of synchronization with the actual API code and increased maintenance burden.
* **Postman Collections** – Useful for testing, but not a full replacement for formal specification and integration into CI/CD workflows.
===== Decision
We decided to use **OpenAPI** to document the project’s RESTful API. The API definition is written in YAML or JSON following the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, and integrated with Swagger UI for interactive documentation. This ensures that API contracts are clear, versioned, and easily accessible for both backend and frontend developers.
===== Consequences
* Standardizes API documentation across the team.
* Allows auto-generation of client libraries and server stubs.
* Supports live testing through Swagger UI.
* Requires maintaining the OpenAPI spec as the API evolves to avoid inconsistencies.
