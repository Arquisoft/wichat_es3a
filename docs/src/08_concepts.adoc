== Cross-cutting Concepts

.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain Model
* **Users**: Represents the players, including data such as name and password.  
* **Questions**: Model that includes the image, statement, answer options (correct and incorrect), and the source (Wikidata).  
* **Hints**: Data dynamically generated from a language model (LLM).  
* **Historic**: Model that includes the answers of the users to questions in the game, it saves the question, the options, answer of the user and the correct answwer.
* **Ranking**: Model that includes the stats of users. It has data as the number of correct and incorrect answers, total points obtained and time played by the user.

=== User Experience concepts (UX)
The user interacts with the application through a user interface. In this interface, the user must either register or log in. Once the user has been identified, they can start a quiz or check their participation history.

Regarding the quiz, the user will see a question on the screen along with a series of possible answers. When one of these answers is selected, the user will receive feedback based on whether the chosen answer is correct or not. Additionally, there will be a chat in the bottom left corner that will interact with the user to provide a series of hints.

=== Microservices architecture
The system will work coordinating little closed systems called microservices, these will be complete applications that work together using an API manager (gateway) so they comunicate and give the user a complete experience.

=== Data Persistence
To assure the data persistence we will use a non relational DB (using mongoDB) with schemas that will connect the data for every service in the way they need, without the rigidity of relational DBs.

=== Security
To assure that the passwords are safely saved in our DB, the system wil crypt them using bCrypt.
