== Testing Report

=== Unit Tests
During this testing cycle, the system was evaluated using code coverage metrics and code duplication analysis.
Overall code coverage reached 80.9%, which is acceptable but could be improved.
Code duplication remains low at 1.8%, indicating good technical health of the codebase.
Each component was tested with its own test suite, covering the main functionalities of the component.

==== Code Coverage
We used SonarCloud to analyze the code coverage and code duplication of our unit tests. The results are as follows:

As shown above, code coverage exceeds 80%, which was our target, and code duplication remains below 3%.
Achieving these results was a challenging task, but we succeeded thanks to the collective effort of the entire team.
Some components are not covered at all, but they are either non-critical to the system or contain functionalities that are not essential.

== Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests are designed to automatically ensure that the system fulfills its functional requirements,
verifies its integrityâ€”especially in relation to external sources like Wikidata and detects potential issues that might otherwise go unnoticed during development.
These tests play a crucial role in validating the system from the user's perspective and help maintain overall reliability as the system evolves.\n
We tested the following scenarios:
- User registration
- User login
- Gameplay
- Historic page

== Load Tests

Load tests are designed to evaluate the system's performance under various conditions, including high traffic and heavy loads.
These tests help identify potential bottlenecks and ensure that the system can handle the expected number of users and requests without degradation in performance.
