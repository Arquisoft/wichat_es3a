[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk | Relevance |  Considerations
| Limited knowledge of certain tools or languages | High | A solution could be to use the tools and languages that are most well-known to the team members. Also, each member should try to learn those aspects they know less about.
| Limited expertise in emerging technologies | High | Ignorance of emerging technologies relevant to the project might result in missed opportunities for innovation and efficiency.
| The team has not worked together before | Low | A suggestion could be to mantain a good communication and inform about any aspect that could affect others.
| Delivery time | Medium | Being  many members can difficult the communication. However, if the previous suggestions are followed there should not be any problem.
| Connection failure | Medium | It is possible that some of the parts of the project that may require a connection to a server are not available, and due to time it may cause problems.
| Documentation | Low | Since the documentation is carried out at the same time as the project, it can generate delays.
