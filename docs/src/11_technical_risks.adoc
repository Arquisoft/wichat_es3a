== Risks and Technical Debts 

=== Risks
[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk | Relevance | Considerations
| Limited knowledge of certain tools or languages | High | A solution could be to use the tools and languages that are most well-known to the team members. Also, each member should try to learn those aspects they know less about.
| Limited expertise in emerging technologies | High | Ignorance of emerging technologies relevant to the project might result in missed opportunities for innovation and efficiency.
| The team has not worked together before | Low | A suggestion could be to maintain a good communication and inform about any aspect that could affect others.
| Delivery time | Medium | Being many members can difficult the communication. However, if the previous suggestions are followed there should not be any problem.
| Connection failure | Medium | It is possible that some of the parts of the project that may require a connection to a server are not available, and due to time it may cause problems.
| Documentation | Low | Since the documentation is carried out at the same time as the project, it can generate delays.
| Team member losses | High | This causes reorganization of all tasks and breaks the flow.
| International power failure | High | A global power outage could disrupt development activities and delay the project. Contingency planning, such as using backup power systems and ensuring critical systems are stored in cloud environments, might mitigate this risk.

=== Technical debts 
[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Technical Debt | Relevance |  Considerations
| Not implementing automated tests from the beginning | High | It is not a recommended practice and can avoid problems in the future.
| Excessive separation of duties | Low | This results in team members being unaware of project modules they did not work on.
| Few security measures | Medium | There are security holes in the application.
